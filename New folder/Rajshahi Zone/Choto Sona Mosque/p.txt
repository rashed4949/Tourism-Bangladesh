One of the most graceful monument
 of the Sultanate period
 is the Chhota Sona Masjid or 
Small Golden Mosque at
 Gaur in Rajshahi Built by 
one Wali Muhammad during the reign
 of Sultan Alauddin Husain Shah
 (1493-1519). 
Originally it was roofed over 
with 15 gold-gilded domes 
including the 3 Chauchala domes
 in the middle row,
 from which it derives its curious name.
