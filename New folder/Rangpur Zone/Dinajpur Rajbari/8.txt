Dinajpur Rajbari now in ruins,
 is situated on the north-east
 outskirts of the present town.
 Originally enclosed within 
defensive moats and high rampart,
 the derelict remains of
 the Dinajpur Rajbari, 
can now be approached through 
a tall arched gate facing west.
 Inside the palace 
precinct near the gateway 
on left is a painted Krisna
 temple and on right, some ruined
 outhouses and another inner
 gateway that provides access
 to an inner square court.
