St. Martins Island is the most beautiful
 Coral Island where you will
 find live corals. 
Its only 30 km from Teknaf 
and you can go there by local motorboat,
 tourist boats, or sea truck.
This small coral island about
 10km (6mi) southwest of the
 southern tip of the mainland 
is a tropical cliche, 
with beaches fringed with coconut palms
 and bountiful marine life.
