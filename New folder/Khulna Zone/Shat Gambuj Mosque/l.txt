In mid-15th century,
 a Muslim colony was founded
 in the inhospitable mangrove forest
 of the Sundarbans near the seacoast 
in the Bagerhat district
 by an obscure saint-General,
 named Ulugh Khan Jahan. 
He was the earliest torch bearer
 of Islam in the South who laid 
the nucleus of an affluent city
 during the reign of Sultan
 Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah (1442-59),
 then known as 'Khalifalabad' 
(present Bagerhat).
